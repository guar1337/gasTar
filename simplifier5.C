// The class definition in simplifier5.h has been generated automatically

// The following methods are defined in this file:
//	 Begin():		  called every time a loop on the tree starts,
//						  a convenient place to create your histograms.
//	 SlaveBegin():	called after Begin(),	when on PROOF called only on the
//						  slave servers.
//	 Process():		called for each event,	in this function you decide what
//						  to read and fill your histograms.
//	 SlaveTerminate: called at the end of the loop on the tree,	when on PROOF
//						  called only on the slave servers.
//	 Terminate():	 called at the end of the loop on the tree,
//						  a convenient place to draw/fit your histograms.
//
